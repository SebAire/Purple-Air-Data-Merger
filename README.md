# About
- This is an R Shiny App that allows you to tidy Purple Air Data that has been downloaded from an SD card from an offline Purple Air sensor. 
- Corrected data uses US EPA's Simple Correction Factor which is described in detail here: https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4617-2021
- The data will be corrected and only show the columns that are necessary to be compared to FEM PM instruments. 
- This code will only work with data downloaded from an SD card and not data downloaded from the Purple Air Map.

# Notes
**Please Note:** App will not work correctly in R studio's native web launcher please change settings in Run App -> set to run External or select open in Browser when running it in R studio.
